# MakeupSelector

The Makeup Selector CLI app is designed to provide easy access to a wide array of cosmetics to allow you to find new products to try. First, you can select a makeup category (blush, eyeshadow, etc.), which will return a list of that category's products, with product name, brand, and price. From that list you can select a product for which you'd like a full description. Exit if you're satisfied, or go back through to find another product!

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'makeup_selector'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install makeup_selector
